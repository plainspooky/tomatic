Tomatic
=======
**Tomatic** is a library that helps add automatic setup capabilities
on **Python** programs and avoids that configuration files became
bloated with unnecessary lines of code. It has originally designed to
be used in `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ projects working
directly in `settings.py` but can be used with any other Python
program.


Requirements
------------
Requires at least **Python 3.5** due the use of type hints
(`PEP484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_).

Installing
----------
Use `pip` to install **Tomatic**, running:

`pip install tomatic`

Or you can clone or download this repository for manual install.

Documentation
-------------
Read the full
`documentation <https://plainspooky.github.io/tomatic/index.html>`_ to
